### What is Dagger? 
Dagger is a self project of my github page for self improvement in skill area. Completely made in luau and interpreted by with: https://github.com/lune-org/lune

### Well, let's go straight into basic syntax

## Syntax

To state a new variable the keyword *let* is used. Here a example :
```
let foo = "bar"
```
you don't have to specify the type explicitly.
```
let foo : string = "bar"
```
To create a loop the syntax is even simple
```
while () {
}
```
Inside of parentheses you going to put the operation like:
```
let foo = true
while (foo == true) {
	console.display("Foo!")
}
```
